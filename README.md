This project monitors soil pH and soil moisture (humidity) and performs two main actions:  
✅ If soil moisture drops below a set threshold, it starts irrigation (activating a water pump or a valve).  
✅ If soil pH drops too low or goes too high, it parses an alert and notifies you by sending an email.
